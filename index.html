	<h2>1. Favorite trip ðŸ˜»</h2>
	    <p>Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·
		 <ul>
			Coming from a family that has lived in Brazil for half their lives, a beautiful Brazilian grandmother, I've been lucky enough to discover and immerse myself in this culture. I love this culture for the language, the food and the very open mentality that makes it easy to interact with locals in Brazil.

	<p>United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</p>
        <ul>
            I inherited my father's admiration for the limits of innovation that are constantly being pushed back in these countries. Businesses have a freedom that is unique to the country, allowing them to grow and make better headway than any other country. What's more, I've been lucky enough to experience all the different landscapes and climates in the U.S. on the same trip!
        </ul>
